    # Each Expansion Example

    This example demonstrates multi-file output using the `each` config.
    It generates a handler and routes file for each service you specify.

questions:
  - name: "services"
    prompt:
      message: "Service names"
      loop: true

computed:
  service_count: "{{ len .Scaffold.services }}"

each:
  - services

presets:
  test:
    services: ["auth", "users", "posts"]
