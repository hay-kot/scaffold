Scaffold is a project generation tool similar to [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) written in Go that leverages the Go template engine to generate projects from a template. It is designed to be used with git or the local file system with a built in "scaffold" management system for versions and templates.

What set's Scaffold apart from projects like cookiecutter is the ability to define reusable scaffolds called `template scaffolds` within a project to help bootstrap code changes in existing projects.

You're able to use a `.scaffolds` directory within a project to define a scaffold that can generate files in multiple locations around your project. This is useful for generating boilerplate starter code for:

- React/Vue/Angular/... components
- Ansible Roles
- CRUD API endpoint stubs
- Other commonly structured code folders

See the [examples](https://github.com/hay-kot/scaffold/tree/main/.examples) folder for some examples of how to use Scaffold.

## Core Features
